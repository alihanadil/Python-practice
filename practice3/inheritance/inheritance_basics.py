# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
#Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other class:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:

x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()

#Create a class named Student, which will inherit the properties and methods from the Person class:
#Use the Student class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:
class Student(Person):
  pass 
x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname() 


# When you add the __init__() function, the child class will no longer inherit the parent's __init__() function.

# Note: The child's __init__() function overrides the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function.

# To keep the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function, add a call to the parent's __init__() function:
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)
